Books 2 provided a nice interface for managing small collections, but that interface did     	not scale well past several hundred books. Furthermore, the codebase made it difficult to     	add new functionality such as plugins and fast searching. Books 3 was created to address     	these problems.</p>     	     <p>Books 3 uses a number of Apple technologies introduced in MacOS X 10.4 "Tiger". Some of      	these technologies include Spotlight, CoreData, and WebKit. The upside of using these      	technologies is that Books 3 is much more stable and robust than any previous versions. The     	downside is that people who have not upgraded to MacOS X 10.4 will not be able to run Books.     	We believe that the improvements offered by MacOS X 10.4 are good enough that we have no     	problems recommending the upgrade.</p>          <p>To bring your Books 2 data into Books 3, you need to follow these steps:</p>          <p>1. Save your Books 2 data (a <tt>.books</tt> file) somewhere convenient. The Desktop works well for      	this.</p>     	     <p>2. Start Books 3 and go to the <tt>File→Import</tt>     	menu, and select <tt>Books 2.0 Importer</tt>.</p>     	     <p>3. Books will launch the plugin, which will ask you for your previous Books data. Point it      	to the <tt>.books</tt> file saved in step 1. The plugin will parse the file and list the books it      	found. By default, all of these are highlighted. Click <tt>Import</tt> to import the data into Books     	3.</p>	 <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/books2-importer.png" /><br />      Books 2.0 Importer</p>     	     <p>Books 3 will create a new list with your older data. You may reorganize your collection as     	you see fit. Note that some cover images will appear very small in Books 3. You can fix this     	by deleting the cover image in the book information window and fetching a new version online     	or dragging in a high resolution scan.</p>     		  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>Books has gone through three major rewrites. Books 1 taught us how to program on the Mac,        while Books 2 taught us how to create more complex applications. Thus far, Books 3 has been        a lesson to us in creating better user interfaces and more scalable desktop applications.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
