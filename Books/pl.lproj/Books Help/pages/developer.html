If you're       comfortable writing object-oriented Obj-C code and enjoy working in Xcode and have some ideas      that you'd like to implement, <a href="mailto:books@aetherial.net">drop us a line</a>.</p>            <p>If you're not a Cocoa programmer, but do develop in other languages, you may want to take a      look at developing Books plugins. We are happy to provide the necessary wrappers for your       Java, Python, Ruby, and &lt;insert language here&gt; code. Most of the plugins are written in      languages other than Objective-C. Again, <a href="mailto:books@aetherial.net">drop us a line</a>      for more details.</p>      <p><b>Are you a designer?</b><br />      If you're a designer, we are always looking for help with new icons and display plugins. If       this might interest you, <a href="mailto:books@aehterial.net">drop us a line</a>.</p>      <p><b>Do you speak another language?</b><br />      Books has been translated into several languages purely through the efforts of dedicated       volunteers. Enrico Richter manages the Books translations, so       <a href="http://www.lefrax.com/MySQL/wordpress/?page_id=41">contact him</a> if you would like       to contribute a translation.</p>            <p><b>Are you just a regular user who wants to help out?</b><br />      If you don't code, design, or translate, we can still use your help. Books is only as good as       the feedback we receive. We like getting bug reports and feature suggestions. If you find a       problem with Books, please report it so that we can fix it. If you have an idea for a great      feature that Books is missing, <a href="mailto:books@aetherial.net">please let us know</a>.</p>            <p>Likewise, you can help us by getting the word out about Books. You can do this by mentioning      it in conversation (when relevant, of course), posting a link to your blog or journal, or       writing some feedback at any number of the Mac software review sites.       (<a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/app/books">iusethis</a>,       <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/12713">MacUpdate</a>, and       <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20697">VersionTracker</a> are      popular ones.)</p>	  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>Typical refinements to the Books interface have been products of this process: A user tells us         that some aspect of the interface could be better by doing X or doing what another app does. The         developer scrambles to learn how to do this, and implements the tweak in his local build. He sends        the changes to a handful of trusted testers and gets their feedback. If the feedback is positive,        the change usually shows up in the next release.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
