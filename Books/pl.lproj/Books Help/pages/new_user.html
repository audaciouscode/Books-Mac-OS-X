If you're a developer, we invite you to download the Books source and make     	any modifications or improvements that you would like. We license the Books source under the      	extremely liberal <a href="license.html">BSD license</a>.</p>          <p><b>Books is designed for books.</b><br/> We used a number of general-purpose cataloging programs      	in the past, and while we appreciate that the developers tried to accommodate our movie,      	video game, and music collections. However, these programs were too general and did not      	focus on books as much as we would have liked. We found ourselves frustrated with a lack of     	specific fields, limited search, and all of the compromises necessary to cram all media      	into a single catalog.</p>	 <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/book-basic.png" /><br />      The Information Window</p>     	     <p>To be clear, Books works well with almost any form of printed media. We use it to keep track     	of our books, comic books, audio books, and magazines. A useful rule of thumb is this: if it     	has an author Books will probably accommodate it.</p>     	     <p><b>Books works offline.</b><br/> We live in an age of ubiquitous connectivity and while Books      	includes some online features (such as Quickfill), it works just as well when your computer is     	offline as it does when your computer is online.</p>     	     <p><b>Plugins! Plugins! Plugins!</b><br/> Books features a plugin architecture that addresses four     	areas: Quickfill, import, export, and display. Plugins can be installed using the <tt>Plugin      	Manager</tt> (located under the <tt>Window</tt> menu).</p>	 <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/plugin-manager.png" /><br />      The Plugin Manager</p>     	     <p><a href="quickfill.html">Quickfill plugins</a> provide connections to other online libraries     	to make your task of entering book information      	easier. Unlike some of our competitors, Books can talk to a large number of online sources,      	including national libraries around the world. (Though to be fair, the competition is      	catching up.)</p>          <p><a href="importing.html">Import plugins</a> allow you to load your information     	from other applications and services into Books. Do you want to see how well Books works      	with your library? Import your data and see.</p>     	     <p><a href="exporting.html">Export plugins</a> let you take your information out of Books and      	use it elsewhere. You can export your collection as a web site, a set of notes on your iPod,     	a small application on your mobile phone, or as an upload to many of the popular book swapping     	sites.</p>     	     <p><a href="display.html">Display plugins</a> allow you to customize the look and feel of the     	book detail view in the main window to suit your aesthetic tastes. Don't like the default     	view (and know some HTML and CSS)? Create your own.</p>	  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>The first version of Books was released in 2003. At that time, there were two notable        book applications on the Mac: Library and Readerware. Since then, a number of developers have        released similar applications such as Booxter, Bookpedia, and Delicious Library. Readerware        is still around and quite popular on the Windows platform.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
