There are some       	books that get better with each reading and you can use this to track how your opinion has      	changed. You can also use this to keep track of friends' and family's feedback, too.</p>	  <p>The <tt>Lending</tt> tab allows you to track who you've lent your books to. It's fully integrated 	  	with Address Book, so your friends are already listed under the <tt>Borrower</tt> field. To add a 	  	new "check out, simply click the "New Entry" button and fill out the information. If you 	  	have not defined any copies for a particular record, you may leave the <tt>Copy</tt> field blank 	  	and it will still work.</p> 	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/lending.png" border="0" /><br />      	The "Lending" Tab</p>	  <p>Finally, the <tt>Files</tt> tab allows you to associate files with book records.
