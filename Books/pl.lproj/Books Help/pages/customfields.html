Books does not support every imaginable field out      	of the (virtual) box, and provides a reasonable set of defaults that cover most cataloging       	needs.</p>            <p>However, there are times where you will want to use a field that Books does not support.       	Here's how it is done:</p>      	      <p>1. From the book information window, select the <tt>Extended Info.</tt> tab. At the bottom of that      	window is a box labeled <tt>User-Defined Fields</tt>.</p>      	      <p>2. Within that box, add a new field by clicking the <tt>Add</tt> button. You can specify the name       	of the new field and its value.</p>      	      <p>3. That's it!</p>	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/custom-field.png" border="0" /><br />      	A New Custom Field</p>            <p>This new field can be used in other parts of the Books program. To include your field as      	one of the columns in the book list table, go to the preferences and click the <tt>List</tt> tab.       	In the available text field, simply type the name of the new field and it will appear in the      	table in the main window.</p>	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/custom-list.png" border="1" /><br />      	"My new field" Is Now Part Of The Table</p>      	      <p>Do do something similar with the details under the list, click the <tt>Details</tt> tab in the       preferences, uncheck the "Display default fields..." box. Enter your field name in the bottom      text area, just as you did in the <tt>List</tt> preferences.</p>            <p>Two caveats: Books will display and export your custom fields without any issues. However,       	custom fields cannot be used within smart list rules, nor are they searchable from the main       	window's search field. (We are working on this.)	  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>Some Quickfill plugins provide more information than Books has fields. In case, Books        will store the extra information as custom fields. If you see a few custom fields that you         don't remember creating, they were probably created by a Quickfill.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
