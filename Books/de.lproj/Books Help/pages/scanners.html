Books is compatible with any barcode scanner that emulates a keyboard. If      	you're looking for a solid but cheap scanner, we highly recommend looking for a       	<a href="http://stores.ebay.com/The-CueCat-Store">modified Cue:Cat</a> online at places like eBay. To use these kinds of scanners,       	click the <tt>ISBN</tt> field and scan the barcode. Books will convert UPC barcodes to ISBN      	numbers as required, so all you need to do is click the <tt>Quickfill</tt> button after      	scanning.</p>      	      <p>If you have an iSight camera and would like to use it, click the camera lookup icon next to the       	<tt>ISBN</tt> field to bring up the camera window.</p>      	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/isight-icon.png" border="1" /><br />      	Camera Lookup Icon</p>      	      <p>When you click the camera icon, the following window appears.</p>	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/scan.png" border="1" /><br />      	Camera Scanner</p>            <p>To have the camera recognize the book's barcode, position it so that the barcode is as       	sharply focused as possible and within the red lines. If a Books can decode the scan, the       	lines will turn green and the window will disappear. The <tt>ISBN</tt> field will contain      	the scanned number.</p>      	      <p>Note that you may have varying levels of success depending upon what iSight you are using.       	The first iSights featured an automatic focus which works well with this system. The new      	iSights that ship with current Macs are fixed focus and much more difficult to use. If you       	find that it is taking too long, we recommend that you change the light conditions and have      	someone else give it a shot.</p>      		  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>The camera scanning feature is designed to work with Apple's iSight cameras, but it is         compatible with other Firewire video cameras, such as portable home video recorders. If you        have such a camera and would like to use it with Books, the instructions above still apply.         We can't guarantee that it will work perfectly, but it might work better than you expect.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
