        <h1>About Us</h1>
      </div>
      <p>The team behind Books consists of the following</p>
      
      <p><b><a href="http://www.aetherial.net">Chris Karr</a></b><br />
      Chris created the initial version of Books and has been the primary developer since then. He
      is currently a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in communications, with a focus on 
      human-computer interaction. He really likes lunch at Taco Bell.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.lefrax.com/">Enrico Richter</a></b><br />
      Enrico joined the Books project to assist with managing translations. Since then, he has been 
      a valuable addition to the overall development by managing the 
      <a href="http://books.aetherial.net/de">German Books site</a> and other creative work.</p>

      <p><b>Ken McGuire</b><br />
      Ken is our über-beta tester. He has been using Books since the early days and he's the fellow 
      whose library we test major changes against. Ken's large library is probably the thing most 
      responsible for Books good performance. (His library is so large that if Books is snappy with
      that, it'll be snappy with just about everything else.)</p>

        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>Books was originally designed to impress a young lady that Chris was courting in 2003. 
        She had a ton of books and no way to keep track of them, thus Books 1 was born. Since then,
        the two have wed and she is now a happy 
        <a href="http://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> user. Go figure.</p>
