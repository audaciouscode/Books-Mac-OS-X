(Simply go to the       	<tt>File→Export</tt> menu and select your preferred export format.) This is accomplished with      	export plugins. There are several informal main types of export plugins: file, service, and      	device.</p>      	      <p>File exporters take your book information and generate a new file on your local machine.       	This may be as simple as an XML version of your collection, a tab-delimited format suitable      	for loading in spreadsheets or databases, or a PDF file for printing. On the end, you may       	export your collection as a full website consisting of many files and images.</p>            <p>Service exporters export your book data to online services such as book swapping sites.       	These typically will not create a local file, but they often do ask you for your username      	and password for connecting to the service in question. These plugins can connect to       	sites such as <a href="http://www.bookmooch.com">BookMooch</a> and       	<a href="http://www.whatsonmybookshelf.com/">WhatsOnMyBookShelf</a>.</p>      	      <p>Finally, device exporters help you put your book collection on a portable device. Books       	can export your collection as a set of iPod notes. There is also a plugin (that you must       	download using the <tt>Plugin Manager</tt> to put your collection on your Java-compatible (J2ME)       	mobile phone. There is a similar plugin for       	<a href="http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/">Pilot-DB</a> equipped Palm devices.</p>      	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/j2me-exporter.png" border="0" /><br />      	The J2ME Exporter</p>      		  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>We are always looking to expand the export formats that Books supports.
