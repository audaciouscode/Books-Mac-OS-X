Fields correspond to particular details      	about a given book. "Title" is a field. Book records are a collection of fields that       	correspond to an actual book. A book with a "title" of "Hearts in Atlantis" and an "author" of      	"Stephen King" corresponds to the King's compilation of short stories about Vietnam. Lists      	are collection of book records. You may create lists to sort books by authors or have one       	list that contains your whole collection.</p>      	      <p>Smart lists are dynamic collections of books that satisfy some criteria. Smart lists differ      	from regular lists in that you cannot manually add books to a smart list. Furthermore, while      	a book may only be a member of one regular list, it can be a member of many smart lists.</p>      	      <p>Smart lists are configured by selecting a particular smart list and clicking the <tt>Edit      	Smart List</tt> icon in the toolbar. A new window will appear.</p>	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/edit-smartlist.png" border="1" /><br />      	A Smart List Containing Comic Books</p>      	      <p>To make a smart list more restrictive, use the <tt>All</tt> option at the top of the window and      	add additional constraints. To make a smart list more inclusive, use the <tt>Any</tt> option and      	add additional matching options.</p>      	  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>The smart list feature is a pure rip-off of the smart playlist feature in iTunes.
