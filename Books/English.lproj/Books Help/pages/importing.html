Under the <tt>File→Import</tt> menu, you will see      	a variety of importers. (You can also download additional importers from the <tt>Plugin       	Manager</tt>.) Click the desired importer and Books will launch it.</p>	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/tab-importer.png" border="0" /><br />      	Tab-Delimited Text Importer</p>      	      <p>Upon launching, the importer typically will ask you for the file to load. For the simpler       	importers will parse the file and generate a list of books to import. Make sure that all of       	the records you want are selected and click the <tt>Import</tt> button.</p>      	      <p>More advanced importers will often provide an additional interface to help Books understand      	how to read your file. For example, the <tt>Tab Delimited Text Importer</tt> will present the parsed      	information in a mini-spreadsheet view and ask you to assign Books fields to individual      	columns. Other importers may provide different interfaces, so consult any documentation       	provided with those plugins.</p>      		  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>If you are using a homemade database to catalog your book collection and would like to         import your data into Books, the simplest way to do this is to export a tab-delimited text        file and open that file with the <tt>Tab-Delimited Text Importer</tt>. If your information resides         in several files or databases, you will need to aggregate it into one table before         exporting as a text file.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
