<p><b>Getting the Data on Your Palm Device</b></p>

<p>Now that you've exported your data, there are a few more steps before the data is usable on your device.</p>

<p>1. If you haven't already, download <a href="http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/">Pilot-DB</a> and follow the instructions to install it on your device.</p>

<p>2. Locate the file exported by Books. It will end in a ".pdb" extension.</p>

<p><i>If you use <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_palmos.php">The Missing Sync for PalmOS</a>:</i></p>

<p>3. Launch the application. Drag the exported ".pdb" file to the internal memory window. (Pilot-DB does not seem to be able to find databases installed on memory cards.)</p>

<p><i>If you use Palm's Send to Handheld application:</i></p>

<p>3. Drag the exported ".pdb" file to the Send icon.</p>

<p>4. Sync your Mac and Palm device. The files will be installed to your Palm and can be accessed by starting the "DB" application. For notes on using the Pilot-DB application, see the <a href="http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/doc.htm">Pilot-DB manual</a>.</p>
