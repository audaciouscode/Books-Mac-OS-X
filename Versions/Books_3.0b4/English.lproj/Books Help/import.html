<p>While you may use Books to catalog and manage your collection metadata, we realize that you'll want to do other things with your information outside the application. There are a variety of options available. If you are comfortable with working with XML technologies, the Books Folder Exporter will export an XML file and images that encode your collection's properties. If you wish to put your information in a spreadsheet, you can use the Tab-Delimited Text exporter. If you want to avoid acquiring duplicate books by taking your collection with you, you can use the iPod exporter or the Books Micro Edition exporter for cell phones.</p><p>Exporting your book information is easy. Simply select the list you would like to export, and from the file menu, select Export and how you would want your data. A plugin will appear and obtain the relevant information from you. (For example, file-based exporters will ask you where to save the data.) After the plugin finds out what it needs, it will export the information and exit (if applicable).</p>

<p>Importing data is likewise easy. Books supports importing from both files and remote databases and servers. File-based importers will typically ask you for the file you want import into Books, while server-based importers may ask you for other information. When you import data using one of these options, Books will create a new list containing the imported information. You can move the books to other lists and delete the new list if desired. To begin the Import process, select Import and the plugin from the File menu.</p>
