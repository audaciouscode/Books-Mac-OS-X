<h3>New Books users</h3><p>Getting started with Books is simple. If you're reading this help document, you've already installed the application. Congratulations!</p><p>When you first started the application, you may have seen an item in the left-most pane titled "My Books". This is your first book list. You may view the item titled "New Book" by clicking on it in the upper-right table. In the bottom-right table, the book's details appear as formatted text.</p><p>The default data is hardly interesting, so let's add some more information. You can bring up the details window by double-clicking the table entry in the upper-right table or you can also select the book and hit the "Get Info" button in the toolbar. After doing this, a new window will pop up.</p>

<p>This window contains the metadata about this particular record. There is a title and nothing else. You change the title by typing a new value and you can add more basic metadata by filling in the appropriate field. If you have an image file of a book cover, you can drag that into the Cover Image field to set the cover image.</p><p>If you click on the Extended Info. tab, a new set of fields will appear. The upper half of this section consists of more standard fields, while the bottom section presents a table of user-defined information. This table allows you to create your own fields and populate them with your own data. Everybody likes to keep different sets of data about their collection and this table allows you to customize your collection as you see fit.</p><p>If you click the Copies tab, you'll find another table and associated fields. This is intended to let you keep track of multiple copies of the same book. If you have one copy in your living room and another in the bedroom, this is the place to record that. If you're like most people, you generally only have one copy of each book you own, so it's okay to leave this section empty if these fields do not interest you.</p><p>The Reviews tab contains the fields for you to record your reactions and thoughts on a particular book. You can use this to keep track of where you are in a book and to rate the book after you finish reading it. If you read books multiple times (and who doesn't?), you can also record your reactions each time you read the book.</p>

<p>Finally, the Lending History tab is a personally librarian of a sort. You can use this to keep track of who you lend books out to, when they are due and whether the book was returned in time. If you constantly find yourself looking for books and wondering if you lent them out weeks ago, this is the tab for you.</p><h3>Users of previous versions of Books</h3><p>If you were a user of Books 2, it's easy to import your collection into Books 3. After you start the application, go to the Import Menu under File and select Books 2.0 Importer. This will bring up a window where you can select your .books file. After the plugin parses the file, you will be given a list of books to select. If you want to import all of your books, simply push the Import button. The plugin will vanish and Books 3 will let you know that it's importing your collection. When it's finished, you will have a new list named Books 2.0 Data that you can rename as you see fit.</p><p>Next: <a href="books.html">Books &amp; lists</a></p>
