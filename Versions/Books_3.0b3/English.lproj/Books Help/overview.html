<p>Books is a native MacOS X application designed to help you create and maintain lists of records describing the books you own.</p>

<center><img src="images/1.png" border="0" width="50%"/></center>
<p>Books does this by providing you an iTunes-inspired interface that contains lists and items. Lists contain items and items consist of the metadata that describes a particular book.</p><p>Using Books, you can quickly catalog your existing book collection using the assistance of online databases like Amazon and the Library of Congress. Books "talks" with these databases using plugins. A plugin is a small program or script that mediates the interaction between the Books application and the remote database. If you find that you would like Books to talk to other databases, you can enable this by writing a plugin of your own.</p><p>Likewise, Books uses plugins to display and export the information in your collection. Using Books, you can export a copy of your records to your iPod, a text file, or perhaps a remote location. Within the Book application, you can control the display of book information by using simple plugins that use standard technology like HTML and cascading stylesheets to control the layout and formatting elements.</p><p>Books is an open-source application that is made available online for free. There are no serial numbers to manage, no licenses to purchase, or any of that. If you're a software developer and would like to customize Books to work better in your particular circumstances, you are free to download the source code, modify it, and distribute your changes as you see fit.</p><p>Next: <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting started</a></p>
