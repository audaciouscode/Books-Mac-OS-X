<p>Books is a labor of love for us, but we can always use any help we can get. If you're interested in helping us make a better application, here are a few ways you can chip in:</p><h3>"I can program!"</h3><p>If you know Objective-C and are comfortable using Cocoa, there are always features to implement in the core Books application. If you have a feature that you think you would like to write, send us a note at <a href="mailto:books@aetherial.net">books@aetherial.net</a> so we can discuss it.</p><h3>"I can program, but I don't know Objective-C!"</h3><p>That's fine. If you're interested, you can always write a plugin. The core Books application contains plugins written in Python, Ruby, Java, and Bash shell scripting. If you are comfortable with a language that has a decent XML parser, visit</p> <center><p><a href="http://books.aetherial.net">http://books.aetherial.net</a></p></center><p>to find out how to get started writing a plugin.</p><h3>"I can't program, but I'm the Picasso of the Web!"</h3><p>If you know how to do great-looking HTML and CSS designs, we always need good display plugins. Since these are entirely CSS and HTML, no programming experience is need. Just a sense of aesthetics that is better than ours. (Not a high bar to clear...)</p><h3>"I speak another language!"</h3><p>We love translators. <a href="mailto:books@aetherial.net">E-mail us</a> for further information.</p><h3>"I can't do any of that stuff!"</h3><p>That's fine. The thing we've learned about programming for users is that they find interesting ways to break the software or otherwise find the sore spots. If you're a user of Books and want to help out, bug reports and suggestions are always appreciated. Chances are that if you have found a bug, others are finding it also.</p><h3>"I have free money that I like to give away!"</h3><p>Books is a free application and there are no plans to charge for it. However, if you must part with your currency, check out</p><center><p><a href="http://books.aetherial.net">http://books.aetherial.net</a></p></center><p>and look for our tip jar. We won't argue. :-)</p><p>Next: <a href="faq.html">Frequently asked questions</a></p>
