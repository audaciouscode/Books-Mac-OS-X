<p>Unlike prior versions of Books, we've worked really hard to simplify the preferences window. From the preferences window, you can select your default plugins for importing and exporting data, what quickfill source you would like to use, and what theme to use to display book data in the main window.</p>

<p><center><img src="images/6.png" border="0"/></center></p>
<p>These are customizable options that are implemented by plugins. A default set of core plugins is included with the Books application, but additional plugins can be downloaded and installed from -plugin site-. If you wish to remove a particular plugin, you may delete it from the Library/Application Support/Books/Plugins folder in your home folder (or from the root folder if the plugins are installed globally).</p><p>Moving on through the preferences window, the bottom element is a table with field names. You can click the checkbox next to a field name to make it visible in the main window. You may also drag and reorganize the fields in the table to change their order. Using this, set up the fields you want to see so that you can browse your collection quickly.</p><p>There are no save or close buttons on the preferences window. Simply close it to make it go away and your choices will be saved automatically.</p><p>Next: <a href="import.html">Importing &amp; exporting data</a></p>
